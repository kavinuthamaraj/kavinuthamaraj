**Past Experiences**


**Universiti Malaya (UM), Malaysia**<br>
*Quantum Machine Learning Research Intern*
                
*June 2025 – July 2025*

- Under Prof. Vannajan Sanghiran Lee, Head of Centre of Excellence UM Quantum Information Science and Technology (CoE UMQiST) at Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
- Project - Hybrid Quantum-Classical U-Net for Brain Tumor Segmentation.
- Developed and optimized a Classical U-Net and a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN) for brain tumor segmentation on the BraTS2020 dataset, processing 51,475 multi-modal MRI scans (T1, T1c, T2, FLAIR, 240×240×155).
- Achieved 92.35% validation IoU and 0.0704 DiceLoss with Classical U-Net (5.50M parameters), and 90.38% IoU and 0.0936 DiceLoss with HQNN (2.26M parameters), using a 90:10 train-validation split ( 46,328 train, 5,147 val).
- Engineered HQNN by integrating quantum circuits into the bottleneck layer, reducing parameters by 59% (2.26M vs 5.50M) while maintaining competitive IoU (90.38% vs. 92.35%), demonstrating quantum efficiency.
- Implemented per-class IoU metrics for necrosis, edema, and enhancing tumor.
- Generated learning curves and efficiency plots, revealing HQNN’s superior IoU/parameter ratio (4.00e-07 vs 1.68e-07), highlighting potential for resource-constrained medical imaging applications.
- Tools & Technologies: PennyLane, PyTorch, MONAI, Dice Score, nnUNet, Streamlit.

**Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (IISc)**<br>
*Quantum Computing Research Intern – Applied Photonics Lab*
                
*May 2025 – June 2025*

- Internship under Prof. Srinivas Talabattula at the Applied Photonics Lab, part of the Quantum Technology Initiative (IQTI) of IISc Bangalore.
- Designed and simulated 3-qubit bit-flip and phase-flip codes in Qiskit, achieving over 99% logical qubit recovery under simulated noise.
- Implemented Shor’s 9-qubit code to correct both bit-flip and phase-flip errors simultaneously, with syndrome measurements for fault-tolerant correction.
- Developed machine learning-based surface code decoders using feedforward and convolutional neural networks (CNNs),achieving a 10× improvement in pseudo-threshold and 2× increase in threshold.
- Initiated hardware-level implementation of the decoder on an FPGA (Digilent Genesys 2 Kintex-7) to evaluate real-time performance against software simulations.
- Performed photonic simulations using Lumerical MODE and FDTD, including silicon microring resonators for high-Q filtering and resonant feedback, and explored InAs/GaAs quantum dot–silicon cavity integration for enhanced emission and narrow-linewidth lasing.
- Tools & Technologies: Python, Qiskit, NumPy, Qiskit Aer, Scikit-learn, FFNN, CNN, FPGA (Verilog), Lumerical MODE/FDTD.
