I come from a place that takes far more than words to describe it,  I speak a language that is over 2500+ years old, I come from a region where traces of human presence dates back over 10,000 years, I come from a land where love for the language runs so deep  in our people that even our land is named after it, I come from my motherland கோவை (Kovai), modernly know as Coimbatore in the State of தமிழ்நாடு (TamilNadu).

I'm a pre-final year undergraduate student at the National Institute of Technology Raipur, India, majoring in Information Technology (a blend of Computer Science and Electronics Engineering).

Just because I’m still an undergrad and want to be part of a deep tech like quantum computing, I’ve been deferred over 50+ times, left unanswered more than 300+ times, and have been graciously granted opportunities just 7 times. The research experiences I’ve had are only because of those few opportunities, and I remain thankful for them. I’ve made sure to use each one to the fullest.

Some of the professors I’ve worked under, and am excited to work with in the near future, are:

- Prof. Srinivas Talabattula, Applied Photonics Lab, Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (NIRF Rank 1 among all research institutes in India).

- Prof. Vannajan Sanghiran Lee, Centre of Excellence in Quantum Information Science and Technology (QIST), Department of Chemistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (QS World Ranking 58).

- Prof. Wang-Chi Vincent Yeh, X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS, ThermoFisher K-alpha) In-charge, Department of Physics, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan.

- Prof. Dominic Williamson, Nano Institute, The University of Sydney (QS World Ranking 25).

**Past Experience**


**Universiti Malaya (UM), Malaysia**<br>
*Quantum Machine Learning Research Intern*
                
*June 2025 – July 2025*

- Under Prof. Vannajan Sanghiran Lee, Head of Centre of Excellence UM Quantum Information Science and Technology (CoE UMQiST) at Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
- Project - Hybrid Quantum-Classical U-Net for Brain Tumor Segmentation.
- Developed and optimized a Classical U-Net and a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN) for brain tumor segmentation on the BraTS2020 dataset, processing 51,475 multi-modal MRI scans (T1, T1c, T2, FLAIR, 240×240×155).
- Achieved 92.35% validation IoU and 0.0704 DiceLoss with Classical U-Net (5.50M parameters), and 90.38% IoU and 0.0936 DiceLoss with HQNN (2.26M parameters), using a 90:10 train-validation split ( 46,328 train, 5,147 val).
- Engineered HQNN by integrating quantum circuits into the bottleneck layer, reducing parameters by 59% (2.26M vs 5.50M) while maintaining competitive IoU (90.38% vs. 92.35%), demonstrating quantum efficiency.
- Implemented per-class IoU metrics for necrosis, edema, and enhancing tumor.
- Generated learning curves and efficiency plots, revealing HQNN’s superior IoU/parameter ratio (4.00e-07 vs 1.68e-07), highlighting potential for resource-constrained medical imaging applications.
- Tools & Technologies: PennyLane, PyTorch, MONAI, Dice Score, nnUNet, Streamlit.

*May 2025 – June 2025*

- Internship under Prof. Srinivas Talabattula at the Applied Photonics Lab, part of the Quantum Technology Initiative (IQTI) of IISc Bangalore.
- Designed and simulated 3-qubit bit-flip and phase-flip codes in Qiskit, achieving over 99% logical qubit recovery under simulated noise.
- Implemented Shor’s 9-qubit code to correct both bit-flip and phase-flip errors simultaneously, with syndrome measurements for fault-tolerant correction.
- Developed machine learning-based surface code decoders using feedforward and convolutional neural networks (CNNs),achieving a 10× improvement in pseudo-threshold and 2× increase in threshold.
- Initiated hardware-level implementation of the decoder on an FPGA (Digilent Genesys 2 Kintex-7) to evaluate real-time performance against software simulations.
- Performed photonic simulations using Lumerical MODE and FDTD, including silicon microring resonators for high-Q filtering and resonant feedback, and explored InAs/GaAs quantum dot–silicon cavity integration for enhanced emission and narrow-linewidth lasing.
- Tools & Technologies: Python, Qiskit, NumPy, Qiskit Aer, Scikit-learn, FFNN, CNN, FPGA (Verilog), Lumerical MODE/FDTD.
