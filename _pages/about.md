I come from a place that takes far more than words to describe it,  I speak a language that is over 2500+ years old, I come from a region where traces of human presence dates back over 10,000 years, I come from a land where love for the language runs so deep  in our people that even our land is named after it, I come from my motherland கோவை (Kovai), modernly know as Coimbatore in the State of தமிழ்நாடு (TamilNadu).

I'm a pre-final year undergraduate student at the National Institute of Technology Raipur, India, majoring in Information Technology (a blend of Computer Science and Electronics Engineering).

Just because I’m still an undergrad and want to be part of a deep tech like quantum computing, I’ve been deferred over 50+ times, left unanswered more than 300+ times, and have been graciously granted opportunities just 7 times. The research experiences I’ve had are only because of those few opportunities, and I remain thankful for them. I’ve made sure to use each one to the fullest.

Some of the professors I’ve worked under, and am excited to work with in the near future, are:

- Prof. Srinivas Talabattula, Applied Photonics Lab, Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (NIRF Rank 1 among all research institutes in India).

- Prof. Vannajan Sanghiran Lee, Centre of Excellence in Quantum Information Science and Technology (QIST), Department of Chemistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (QS World Ranking 58).

- Prof. Wang-Chi Vincent Yeh, X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS, ThermoFisher K-alpha) In-charge, Department of Physics, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan.

- Prof. Dominic Williamson, Nano Institute, The University of Sydney (QS World Ranking 25).
